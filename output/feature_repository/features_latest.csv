feat_9,NewMerchantMCCVelocityPostEvent,"This feature counts the number of distinct new merchant_id and mcc (Merchant Category Code) combinations encountered by the customer within a short window (e.g., 60 minutes) following a significant event_date/event_time. Fraudsters often test cards or make multiple purchases from new merchants quickly after gaining access. A sudden spike in transactions at previously unvisited merchant types/IDs immediately after an account event is highly suspicious.","event_date,transaction_date,event_time,transaction_time,mcc,merchant_id",0.9,2025-08-01T23:01:43.135653
feat_10,DigitalWalletLink_CNP_Velocity,"Calculates the count of distinct CNP transactions and sum of their amounts occurring within a short time window (e.g., 60 minutes) after a credit card is linked to a digital wallet identifier (digital_code) not previously associated with the customer's account or device.","digital_code,event_date,event_time,transaction_date,transaction_time,transaction_amt,cnp_flag,merchant_id",0.9,2025-08-01T23:05:55.112984
feat_11,FirstTimeHighRisk_SecureCNP,"Identifies Card-Not-Present (cnp_flag) transactions that are successfully authenticated (secure_flag) but represent a first-time purchase for the customer at a merchant with a high-risk Merchant Category Code (mcc) or in an unusual country (merchant_cntry_code), especially if the transaction_amt is significantly higher than the customer's typical online spend.","cnp_flag,secure_flag,mcc,merchant_cntry_code,transaction_amt",0.9,2025-08-01T23:05:55.112984
feat_12,ATO_Sequential_Event_Chain_Detector,"This feature identifies a specific, high-risk sequence of events: a successful online banking login ('digital_code' indicating login) followed within a short time (e.g., 30 minutes) by a sensitive profile update (e.g., address change, 'digital_code' indicating profile update), and then followed within a subsequent short time (e.g., 2 hours) by a high-value cash advance transaction via Faster Payments ('mcc', 'transaction_amt', and 'digital_code' or 'merchant_name' for Faster Payments). It generates a flag (e.g., 1/0) if this sequence is detected.","event_date,event_time,digital_code,transaction_date,transaction_time,transaction_amt,mcc,merchant_name",0.9,2025-08-01T23:29:16.850427
feat_13,High_Velocity_Faster_Payment_Outflow,"Measures the total amount and number of Faster Payments transfers (identified via digital_code) initiated within a short time window (e.g., 15-30 minutes) following a suspected compromised login or during a session with other suspicious activity. This feature flags rapid fund exfiltration, which is typical of ATO via immediate UK payment rails.","transaction_id,transaction_date,transaction_time,transaction_amt,digital_code,event_date,event_time",0.9,2025-08-01T23:32:32.074017
